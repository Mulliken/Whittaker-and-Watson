\chapter{The Equations of Mathematical Physics}
\Section{18}{1}{The differential equations of mathematical physics.}
The functions which have been introduced in the preceding chapters
are of importance in the applications of mathematics to physical
investigations. Such applications are outside the province of this
book; but most of them depend essentially on the fact that, by means
of these functions, it is possible to construct solutions of certain
partial differential equations, of which the following are among the
most important:

(I) Laplace's equation
$$
\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial x^{2}} +
\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial y^{2}} +
\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial z^{2}} =
0,
$$
which was originally introduced in a memoir\footnote{%TODO:footnote
  Mem. de FAcad. des Sciences, 1787 (published 1789), p. 252.}
on Saturn's rings.

If $(x, y, z)$ be the rectangular coordinates of any point in
space, this equation is satisfied by the following functions
which occur in various branches of mathematical physics:

% TODO: convert to itemized(?)
(i) The gravitational potential in regions not occupied by
attractii:ig matter.

(ii) The electrostatic potential in a uniform dielectric, in the
theory of electro- statics.

(iii) The magnetic potential in free aether, in the theory of
magnetostatics.

(iv) The electric potential, in the theory of the steady flow of
electric currents in solid conductoi's.

(v) The temperature, in the theory of thermal equilibrium in solids.

(vi) The velocity potential at points of a homogeneous liquid moving
irrotationally, in hydrodynamical problems,

Notwithstanding the physical diflferences of these theories, the
mathematical investigations are much the same for all of them:
thus, the problem of thermal equilibrium in a solid when the points
of its surface are maintained at given temperatures is
mathematically identical with the problem of determining the
electric intensity in a region when the points of its boundary
are maintained at given potentials.

(II) The equation of ivave motions

dx dy' dz C' dt- This equation is of general occurrence in
investigations of undidatory disturbances propagated with velocity c
independent of the wave length; for example, in the theory of
electric waves and the electro-magnetic theory of light, it is the
equation satisfied by each component of the electric or magnetic
vector; in the theory of elastic vibrations, it is the equati<Mi
satisfied by each component of the displacement; and in the theory of
sound, it is the equation satisfied by the velocity potential in a
perfect gas.

%
% 387
%

(III) The equation of conduction of heat

dfV dfV dfV\ ldV dec- dy dz- k dt

This is the equation satisfied by the temperature at a point of a
homogeneous isotropic body; the constant k is proportional to the
heat conductivity of the body and inversely proportional to its
specific heat and density.

(IV) A particular case of the preceding equation (II), when the
variable z is absent, is

dx- dy- c- dt'

This is the equation satisfied by the displacement in the theory of
transverse vibrations of a membrane; the equation also occurs in the
theory of wave motion in two dimensions.

(V) The equation of telegraphy

This is the equation satisfied by the potential in a telegraph cable
when the inductance X, the capacity K, and the resistance It per unit
length are taken into account.

It would not be possible, within the limits of this chapter, to
attempt an exhaustive account of the theories of these and the other
differential equations of mathematical physics; but, by considering
selected 'typical cases, we shall expound some of the principal
methods employed, with special reference to the uses of the
transcendental functions.

\Section{18}{2}{Boundary conditions.}

A problem which arises very frequently is the determination, for one
of the equations of \hardsectionref{18}{1}, of a solution which is subject to certain
boundary conditions; thus we may desire to find the temperature at
any point inside a homogeneous isotropic conducting solid in thermal
equilibrium when the points of its outer surface are maintained at
given temperatures. This amounts to finding a solution of Laplace's
equation at points inside a given surface, when the value of the
solution at points on the surface is given.

A more complicated problem of a similar nature occurs in discussing
small oscillations of a liquid in a basin, the liquid being exposed to
the atmosphere; in this problem we are given, effectively, the
velocity potential at points of the free surface and the normal
derivate of the velocity potential where the liquid is in contact with
the basin.

The nature of the boundary conditions, necessary to determine a
solution uniquely, varies very much with the form of differential
equation considered, even in the case of equations which, at first
sight, seem very much alike. Thus a solution of the equation

dx- dy'

25-2

%
% 388
%

(which occurs in the problem of thermal equilibrium in a conducting
cylinder) is uniquely determined at points inside a closed curve in
the x7/-ip\ a,ne by a knowledge of the value of V at points on the
curve; but in the case of the equation

da; c- dt-

(which effectively only differs from the former in a change of sign),
occurring

in connexion with transverse vibrations of a stretched string, where V

denotes the displacement at time t at distance x from the end of the

string, it is physically evident that a solution is determined
uniquely only if

dV both V and - are given for all values of x such that x l, when =

(where I denotes the length of the string).

Physical intuitions will usually indicate the nature of the boundary
conditions which are necessary to determine a solution of a
differential equation uniquely; but the existence theorems which are
necessary from the point of view of the pure mathematician are usually
very tedious and difficult*.

\Section{18}{3}{A general solution of Laplace's equation.}

It is possible to construct a general solution of Laplace's equation
in the form of a definite integral. This solution can be employed to
solve various problems involving boundary conditions.

Let V x, y, z) be a solution of Laplace's equation which can be
expanded into a power series in three variables valid for points of x,
y, z) sufficiently near a given point Xf, yo, z ). Accordingly we
write

x = Xq + X, y=zy + Y, z = Zo+ Z;

and we assume the expansion

V = c(o + a X + biY + CiZ + a.. X- + b. Y- + c Z

+ 2cLYZ+2e,ZX + 2f,XY+...,

it being supposed that this series is absolutely convergent whenever

\ X'f+\ Yr + \ Z' a,

where a is some positive constant:]:. If this expansion exists, V is
said to be analytic at (xo, yo, S'o). It can be proved by the methods
of §§ 3*7, 4'7

* See e.g. Forsyth, Theory of Functions (1918), §§ 216-220, where an
apparently simple problem is discussed.

t Whittaker, Math. Ann. lvii. (1902), p. 333.

* The functions of applied mathematics satisfy this condition.

%
% 389
%

that the series converges uniformly throughout the domain indicated
and may be differentiated term-by-term with regard to X, Y or Z any
number of times at points inside the domain.

If we substitute the expansion in Laplace's equation, which may be
written

d'V a F d V dX-' dY-' dZ-' '

and equate to zero (§ 373) the coefficients of the various powers of
X, Y and Z, we get an infinite set of linear relations between the
coefficients, of which

a.2 4- 62 -I- c. = may be taken as typical.

There are n(n - l) of these relations* between the n + 2) n + l)
coefficients of the terms of degree n in the expansion of V, so that
there are only (n+2)(n + 1) - n (n - 1) = 2n -f 1 independent
coefficients in the terms of degree n in V. Hence the terms of degree
n in V must be a linear combination of 2n+l linearly independent
particular solutions of Laplace's equation, these solutions being each
of degree n in X, Y and Z.

To find a set of such solutions, consider (Z + iX cos u 4- iFsin m)";
it is a solution of Laplace's equation which may be expanded in a
series of sines and cosines of multiples of u, thus:

n n

2 gm X, Y, Z) COS mu+ 2 h,, (X, Y, Z) sin. mu,

m = 111 = 1

the functions g iX, Y, Z) and h X, Y, Z) being independent of u. The
highest power of Z in gm X, Y, Z) and A,, (X, F, Z) is Z"'" and the
former function is an even function of Y, the latter an odd function;
hence the functions are linearly independent. They therefore form a
set of 2?i -f- 1 functions of the type sought.

Now by Fourier's rulef \hardsectionref{9}{1}'2)

Trgm X, Y, Z)= j Z + iX cos u + i Fsin u)" cos mudu,

irhyn X, Y, Z)= \ Z + iX cos u -H iFsin uY sin mudu,

J -77

* If a,s,j (where r + s + t = n) be the coefficient of A''T Z' in V,
and if the terms of degree . d-V d V dW, . .,

" ~ WV "*" Wr- "*" dZ arranged primarily in powers of X and
secondarily in powers of F,

the coefficient fl .s.t <loes not occur in any term after Z'- -r Z<
(or ZT*- if r = or 1), and hence the relations are all linearly
independent.

t 27r must be written for tt in the coefficient of g X, Y, Z).

%

and so any linear combination of the 2/; + 1 solutions can be written
in the form

/:

 Z + iX COS i( + iY sin i()' fn u) du,

where / (w) is a rational function of e*".

Now it is readily verified that, if the terms of degree n in the
expression assumed for V be written in this form, the series of terms
under the integral sign converges uniformly if \ X\ \ + \ Y Jr\ Z be
sufficiently small, and so \hardsectionref{4}{7}) w e may write

V =\ Z+iX cos u + iY sin ?()"/ (w) du.

But any expression of this form may be written

F = / F Z - iX cos u + i Y sin u, u) du,

J -n

where i is a function such that differentiations with regard to X, Y
or Z under the sign of integration are permissible. And, conversely,
if F be any function of this type, V is a solution of Laplace's
equation.

This result may be written

J -TT

on absorbing the terms - 2,1 - * o cos m - I'yo sin m into the second
variable; and, if differentiations under the sign of integi-ation are
permissible, this gives a general solution of Laplace's equation;
that is to say, every solution of Laplace's equation which is analytic
throughout the interior of some sphere is expressible by an integral
of the form given.

This result is the three-dimensional analogue of the theorem that

V=f x- iy)+g x-ii/) is the general solution of

ordinary diflFerential equation and general integrals of a i)artial
differential equation of order higher than the first*.

Two apparently distinct primitives are always directly transformable
into one another

by means of suitable relations between the constants; thus in the case
of;T"f +y = 0, we

can obtain the primitive Csin x + t) from A cos .r + 5 sin .r by
defining C and e by the equations Csin e = A, C'cos f = B. On the
other hand, every solution of Laplace's equation is expressible in
each of the forms

but if these are known to be the same solution, there appears to be no
general analytical relation, connecting the functions / and g, which
will directly transform one form of the solution into the other.]

( where jo =, q = ), integrals of Charpit's subsidiary equations (see
Forsyth, Differential

(ii) Az = \ (. +y)3 + 2a2 x-y)-a x -y)- + G a)\ = Aa x-y)-Aa x->ry)-'

and thence obtain a diflferential equation determining the function O

the same.

\Subsection{18}{3}{1}{Solutions of Laplace s equation involving Leg endive functions.}
If an expansion for V, of the form assumed in \hardsectionref{18}{3}, exists when

Xq = y Zq ), we have seen that we can express F as a series of

where n and m are integers such that m n.

We shall now examine these expressions more closely. If we take polar

which is analytic near the origin, can be expr essed in the form

F = i r' \ AnFn (cos (9) + I (yl " ' cos m< + Bn ''' sin m ) P " (cos

where w is a positive integer, is called a surface harmonic of degree
7i; a surface harmonic of degi-ee n multiplied by ?'" is called a
solid harmonic (or a spherical Jiarmonic) of degree n.

The curves on a unit sphere (with centre at the origin) on which P
(cos 6) vanishes are n parallels of latitude which divide the surface
of the sphere into zones, and so P (cos d)

is called (see S 15*1) a zonal harmonic; and the curves on which .
mtb . Pn" (cos 6) vanishes

are n-7n parallels of latitude and 2m meridians, which divide the
surface of the sphere into quadrangles wh(> e angles are right angles,
and so these functions are called tesseral harmonics.

%

%

A solid harmonic of degree n is .evidently a homogeneous polynomial of
degree n in X, y, z and it satisfies Laplace's equation.

It is evident that, if a change of rectangular coordinates* is made
l;)y rotating the axes about the origin, a solid harmonic (or a
surface harmonic) of degree n transforms into a solid harmonic (or a
suz'face harmonic) of degree n in the new coordinates.

Spherical harmonics were investigated with the aid of Cartesian
coordinates by W. Thomson in 1862, see Phil. Trans. (1863), pp.
573-582, and Thomson and Tait, Treatise on Natural Philosophy i.
(1879), jip. 171-218; they were also investigated independently in
the same manner at about the same time by Clebsch, Journal fur Math.
LXi. (1863), pp. 195-262.

shew that P,/" (r) P '" (cos 6) cos wi0 satisfies Laplace's equation.

\Section{18}{4}{The solution of Laplace's equation which satisfies
  assigned boundary conditions at the surface of a sphere.}

We have seen \hardsubsectionref{18}{3}{1}) that any solution of Laplace's equation which
is analytic near the origin can be expanded in the form

w = (

+ i ( <" ' cos m(f) + 5 " ' sin m(f>) P,,"* (cos 6) \

m = l J

and, from \hardsectionref{3}{7}, it is evident that if it converges for a given value
of r, say a, for all values of 6 and (f) such that O tt, - tt tt, it
converges absolutely and uniformly when r < a.

To determine the constants, we must know the boundary conditions which
V must satisfy. A boundary condition of frequent occurrence is that F
is a given bounded integrable function of 6 and (f), say f(0, (f>), on
the surface of a given sphere, which we take to have radius a, and V
is analytic at points inside this sphere.

We then have to determine the coefficients An, -4 <'"', 5,i""* from

Now suppose that we take the line (6, (f>) as a new polar axis and let

expressions of the form

Take as a particular case a drum, that is to say a membrane with a
fixed circular boundary of radius R.

Then one possible type of vibration is given by the equation

the element

f(x sin u cos v + y sin u sin v + z cos u + ct, u, v) 8u Bv being
propagated in the direction (sin u cos v, sin u sin v, cos u) with

axes such that the polar axis is the direction (ff, (f)), and the
plane -v/r = passes through OZ; so that

cos CO = cos 6 cos u + sin d sin u cos ((f) - v),

sin II sin ((f) - v) = sin w sin yjr.

Also, take the arbitrary function /(w, y) to be;S,j (w, y) sin i
where Sn denotes a surface harmonic in u, v of degree ?i; so that we
may write

Sn(u, V) = Sn 0, 4>] CO, yjr),

where \hardsubsectionref{18}{3}{1}) Sn is a surface harmonic in co, -sjr of degree n. We
thus get

V = e ' ' f r I ' e''""°"" Sn 6, < \ w, y\ r) sin a> dw df.

Now we may write (§ 18 "SI)

Sn (d, (i>; 0,y r) = An e,(f>). Pn (COS Oj)

where An 6, </>), n'"'* 6, <p) and 5 ""' 6, 0) are independent of yjr
and co. Performing the integration with respect to -yjr, we get

by Rodrigues' formula (§ loll); on integrating by parts ti times and
using Hankel's integral (§ 17 '3 corollary), we obtain the equation

multiple of e' ' h-' Jj \ \ i(kr) An(0, (f>).

Now the equation of wave motions is unaffected if we multiply x, y, z
and t by the same constant factor, i.e. if we multiply r and t by the
same constant factor leaving Q and unaltered; so that An B, <f)) may
be taken to be independent of the arbitrary constant k which
multiplies r and t.

Hence lim e**-''' r ~ H' ~ " ~ /, i (kr) An 0, 9) is a solution of

of wave motions; and therefore r' An(0, <f>) is a solution
(independent of t) of the equation of wave motions, and is
consequently a solution of Laplace's equation; it is, accordingly,
permissible to take An (0, <f>) to be any surface harmonic of degree n
; and so we obtain the result that

The solution just obtained for the equation of wave motions may be
used in the following manner to determine the periods of free
vibration of air contained in a rigid sphere.

The velocity potential T' satisfies the equation of wave motions and
the boundary

sphere. Hence

This equation determines k; on using \hardsubsectionref{17}{2}{4}, we see that it may be
written in the form

tan ka = ka)

where f (ka) is a rational function of ka.

In particular the radial vibrations, in which V is independent of 6
and <, are given by taking n = 0; then the equation to determine k
becomes simply

tan ka = ka; and the pitches of the fundamental radial vibrations
correspond to the roots of this equation.
