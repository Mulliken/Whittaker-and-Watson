\chapter{The Jacobian Elliptic Functions}

\Section{22}{1}{Elliptic functions with two simple poles.}

In the course of pr6ving general theorems concerning elliptic
functions at the beginning of Chapter xx, it was shewn that two
classes of elliptic functions were simpler than any others so far as
their singularities were concerned, namely the elliptic functions of
order 2. The first class consists of those with a single double pole
(with zero residue) in each cell, the second consists of those with
two simple poles in each cell, the sum of the residues at these poles
being zero.

An example of the first class, namely z), was discussed at length in
Chapter xx; in the present chapter we shall discuss various examples
of the second class, known as Jacobian elliptic functions*.

It will be seen \hardsubsubsectionref{22}{1}{2}{2}, note) that, in certain circumstances, the
Jacobian functions degenerate into the ordinary circular functions;
accordingly, a notation (invented by Jacobi and modified by Gudermann
and Glaisher) will be employed which emphasizes an analogy between the
Jacobian functions and the circular functions.

From the theoretical aspect, it is most simple to regard the Jacobian
functions as quotients of Theta-functions \hardsubsectionref{21}{6}{1}). But as many of
their fundamental properties can be obtained by quite elementary
methods, without appealing to the theory of Theta-functions, we shall
discuss the functions without making use of Chapter xxi except when it
is desirable to do so for the sake of brevity or simplicity.

\Subsection{22}{1}{1}{The Jacobian elliptic functions, TODO, TODO, TODO.}
It was shewn in
§ 21 "61 that if

y '\$,,% ul%'y the Theta-functions being formed with parameter t, then

where k = o (0 ! t)/ 3 (0 | r). Conversely, if the constant h (called
the modulus-f) be given, then, unless k- 1 or /c- O, a value of r can
be found

* These functions were introduced by Jacobi, but many of their
properties were obtained independently by Abel, who used a different
notation. See the note on p. 512.

t If 0</c<l, and is the acute angle such that sin d = k, 6 is called
the modular angle.

(§§ 21-7-21-712) for which V (0 t) V (0 t) = A--, so that the sokition
of the differential equation

;|y=(i-yn(i-%')

subject to the condition ( -y ) = 1 is

the Theta-functions being formed with the parameter t which has been
determined.

The differential equation may be written

to=i\ l-t-)- - l-k-H')- -dt, Jo

and, by the methods of \hardsubsectionref{21}{7}{3}, it may be shewn that, if y and a are
con- nected by this integral formula, y may be expressed in terms of u
as the quotient of two Theta-functions, in the form already given.

Thus, if

Jo y may be regarded as the function of u defined by the quotient of
the Theta- functions, so that y is an analytic function of u except at
its singularities, which are all simple poles; to denote this
functional dependence, we write

y = sn(? k), or simply y= sn u, when it is unnecessary to emphasize
the modulus*. The function sn u is known as a Jacobian elliptic
function of ii, and

[Unless the theory of the Theta-functions is assumed, it is
exceedingly difficult to shew that the integral formula defines y as a
function of u which is analytic except at simple poles. Cf. Hancock,
Elliptic Functions, i. (New York, 1910).]

Then, from the relation of \hardsectionref{21}{6}, we have

 - sn i( = en M dn (/ (I),

* The modulus will alwaj's be iuserted when it is not k.

%
% 493
%

and from the relations of § 21 '2, we have

sn- u + cn u = 1 (II),

k' sn- u + dn- u = l (Ill),

and, obviously, en -= dn = 1 (I )-

"We shall now discuss the properties of the functions sn u, en u, dn u
as defined bj' the equations (A), (B), (C) by using the four relations
(I), (II), (III), (IV); these four relations are sufficient to make
sn u, on u, dn u determinate functions of u. It will be assumed, when
necessary, that sn u, en m, dn u are one-valued functions of ti,
analytic except at their poles; it will also be assumed that they are
one-valued analytic functions of k' when cuts are made in the plane of
the complex variable k from 1 to -f oo and from to - xi .

\Subsection{22}{1}{2}{Simple properties of TODO, TODO, TODO.}

From the integral u= j (1 - t-) (1 - k'-t-) 2 df it is evident, on
writing

Jo

- t for t, that, if the sign of y be changed, the sign of u is also
changed.

Hence sn u is an odd function of u.

Since sn (- ii) = - sn u, it follows from (II) that en (- u) = + en u;
on account of the one-valuedness of en u, by the theory of analytic
continuation it follows that either the upper sign, or else the lower
sign, must always be taken. In the special case u = 0, the upper sign
has to be taken, and so it has to be taken always; hence cn -u) = cnu,
and cnu is cm even function of u. In like manner, dn u is an even
function of u.

These results are also obvious from the definitions (A), (B) and (C)
of §2211.

Next, let us differentiate the equation sn- u + en- u = l; on using
equation (I), we get

d en a T

- z - = - sn u dn u; du

in like manner, from equations (III) and (I) we have

d dn u, - -, - = - A;- sn u en u. du

\Subsubsection{22}{1}{2}{1}{Tlie complementary TODO modulus.}

If k- + k'- = 1 and ' -f 1 as k 0, k' is known as the complementary
modulus. On account of the cut in the --plane from 1 to -f x, k' is a
one- valued function of k.

[With the aid of the Theta-functions, we can make k' one-valued, by
defining it to be

22122. Glaiskers notation* for quotients.

A short and convenient notation has been invented by Glaisher to
express

reciprocals and quotients of the Jacobian elliptic functions; the
reciprocals

are denoted by reversing the order of the letters which express the
function,

thus

ns u = 1/sn u, nc u = l /en u, nd = 1 /dn u;

while quotients are denoted by writing in order the first letters of
the

numerator and denominator functions, thus

sc u = sn u/cn u, sd u - sn ? /dn u, cd u = en w/dn w, cs w = en w/sn
w, ds u = dn ujsn u, dc u = dn u/cn u.

[Note. Jacobi's notation for the functions sn rt, en u, dn u was sinam
u, cosam m, Aamw, the abbreviations now in use being due to
Gudermannt, who also wrote tuu, as an abbreviation for tanam u, in
place of what is now written sc u.

The reason for Jacobi's notation was that he regarded the inverse of
the integral

u= |*(l-Fsin2 )- rf

as fundamental, and wrote J ( = am w; he also wrote A = (l-/?-- sin c
)- for -j- .] Example. Obtain the following results:

\Section{22}{2}{The addition-theorem for the function TODO.}

We shall now shew how to express sn (u + v) in terms of the Jacobian
elliptic functions of u and v; the result will be the
addition-theorem for the function sn u; it will be an
addition-theorem in the strict sense, as it can be written in the form
of an algebraic relation connecting sn u, sn v, sn u + v).

[There are numerous methods of establishing the result; the one given
is essentially due to Euler*, who was the first to obtain (in 1756,
1757) the integral of

quartic function of X and Y is the same quartic function of y.

Three t other methods are given as examples, at the end of this
section.]

Suppose that xi and v vary while u- v remains constant and equal to a,
say, so that

dv \ die

Now introduce, as new variables, Sj and Sg defined by the equations

Si - sn %i, Sn = sn v,

so thatj .V = (1 - s ) (1 -]es \

and 4- = (1 - s.f) (1 - I:? si), since xr = .

Differentiating with regard to u and dividing by 2si and 24
respectively, we find that, for general values § of u and v,

Si = - ( 1 + A;-) Si + IhH, if. = - (1 + A; 52 + Ih s-f.

Hence, by some easy algebra,

S\ Sn - S Sx Zk S1S2 \ Si - 2 )

Si's.:r-S./S,' ~ si-Sx ) l-k'Sx si) '

and so

(s,s, - s,s,)-' ~ (s,s, - s,s;) = (1 - k's.W)-' (1 - k's,%');

on integrating this equation we have

S1S2 s Si

1 - k 81 82'

where C is the constant of integration.

Replacing the expressions on the left by their values in terms of u
and v we get \

en ?i dn M sn y + en w dn w sn u 1 -k sn u sn v

* Acta Petropolitana, vi. (1761), pp. 35-57. Euler had obtaiued some
special cases of this result a few years earlier.

t Another method is given by Legendre, Fonctions Elliptiques, i.
(Paris, 1825), p. 20, and an interesting geometrical proof was given
bj- Jacobi, Journal fur Math. iii. (1828), p. 376. X For brevity, we
shall denote differential coefficients with regard to u by dots, thus

dv .. d v du dii

8 I.e. those values for which en u dn u and cnv nv do not vanish.

%

That is to say, we have two integrals of the equation du + dv = 0,
namely ) u + v= a and (ii)

sn u en V dn V + sn ?; en M dn u

1 - k sn" u sn v

= G,

each integral involving an arbitrary constant. By the general theory
of differential equations of the first order, these integrals cannot
be functionally independent, and so

sn u en v dn v + sn v en u dn u 1 - A;- sn ii sn"-* v

is expressible as a function oi u + v; call this function f(u + v).

On putting i; = 0, we see that /(u)=snw; and so the function / is the
sn function.

We have thus demonstrated the result that

- ., dn dn V - k- sn w sn v en u en v dn (u + v) = rw- - .;

the most simple method of obtaining them is from the formula for sn (u

Using the notation introdueed at the end of \hardsectionref{22}{2}, we have (1 - k's

and so en (u + v) = + - - r ~ -

But both of these expressions are one- valued funetions of u, analytic
exeept at isolated poles and zeros, and it is ineonsistent with the
theory of analytic continuation that their ratio should be + 1 for
some values of u, and - 1 for other values, so the ambiguous sign is
really definite; putting li = 0, we see that the plus sign has to be
taken. The first formula is consequently proved.

The formula for dn u + v) follows in like manner from the identity (1

\Section{22}{3}{The constant K.}
We have seen that, if

u=\ \ l- )- ~ l-kH'')- ~dt,

J then y = sn u, k).

If we take the upper limit to be unity (the path of integration being
a straight line), it is customary to denote the value of the integral
by the symbol K, so that sn K, k)= 1.

[It will be seen in \hardsubsubsectionref{22}{3}{0}{2} that this detinition of A' is equivalent
to the definition as TT a in \hardsubsectionref{21}{6}{1}.]

%
% 499
%

It is obvious that en = and dn K= ± k': to fix the ambiguity in sign,
suppose < A' < 1, and trace the change in (1 - k'H-) as t increases
from to 1; since this expression is initially unity and as neither of
its branch points (at t = ± k~ ) is encountered, the final value of
the expression is positive, and so it is + A '; and therefore, since
dn is a continuous function of k, its value is always + k'.

The elliptic functions of K are thus given by the formulae sniT-l, cn
= 0, dn K = k'.

\Subsubsection{22}{3}{0}{1}{The expression of K in terms of k.}

In the integral defining K, write t = sin <, and we have at once

K \ (l-A-2sin-(/))- cZ(/>.

J

When \ k\ < \, the integi-and may be expanded in a series of powers of
k, the series converging uniformly with regard to (by \hardsubsectionref{3}{3}{4}, since
sin-" ( 1 ); integrating term-by-term \hardsectionref{4}{7}), we at once get

K=\ \ F \, \; 1; k =\ \ Fl\, 1;

where c = k" . By the theory of analytic continuation, this result
holds for all values of c when a cut is made from 1 to -l- oo in the
c-plane, since both the integrand and the hypergeometric function are
one-valued and analytic in the cut plane. Example. Shew that

(Legendre, Fonctions Elliptiques, i. (1825), p. 62.)

\Subsubsection{22}{3}{0}{2}{The equivalence of the definitions of K-}

Taking = 3- in \hardsubsectionref{21}{6}{1}, we see at once that \&n hTrd ) = \ and so
cn(|7r53-) = 0. Consequently, 1 - sn m has a double zero at \ 7r i .
Therefore, since the number of poles of sn w in the cell with corners
0, nS, n t- ) B, tt (r - 1) .93'- is two, it follows from \hardsubsectionref{20}{1}{3}
that the only zeros of 1 - sum are at the points = Jn-
(4?n-l-l-|-2?ir) 3, where m and n are integers. Therefore, with the
definition of \hardsectionref{22}{3},

A'=|7r(4m-l-l+2 r)532.

Now take t to be a pure imaginary, so that < /( < 1, and K is real;
and we have ?i = 0, so that

\ TT Am + l)B = j ''(l->t2sin2 0)~2(/,

where m is a positive integer or zero; it is obviously not a negative
integer.

If m is a positive integer, since / (1 - k' sin 4>)~ i * continuous
function of a and

J so passes through all values between and K as a increases from to
tt, we can find a value of a less than tt, such that

A7(4?ra -I- 1 ) = hrrS = f " ( 1 - P sin2 cj))- dc;

and so sn ( TrSs ) = sin a < 1,

which is untrue, since sn (-177 32) = 1.

Therefore m must he zero, that is to say we have

But both K and n - are analytic functions of / when tlie o-plane is
cut from 1 to + 00, and so, by the theory of analytic continuation,
this result, proved when 0< -<l, persists throughout the cut plane.

The equivalence of the definitions of K has therefore been
established. Example 1. By considering the integral

J shew that sn 2K= 0.

Example 2. Prove that

[Notice that when u = \ K, cn2M = 0. The simplest way of determining
the signs to be attached to the various radicals is to make --a-O,

The intimate connexion of K with periodic properties of the functions

2235. General description of the functiotis sn u, en u, dn u.

The foregoing investigations of the functions sn u, en u and dn u may
be summarised in the following terms:

(I) The function sn m is a doubly-periodic function of u with period:?
K, 2iK'. It is analytic except at the points congruent to iK' or to 2K
+ iK' (mod. 4jfir, 2iK'); these points are simple poles, the residues
at the first set all being k~ and the residues at the second set all
being - k~; and the function has a simple zero at all points
congruent to (mod. 2K, 2iK').

It may be observed that sn u is the only function of u satisfying this
description; for if (m) were another such function, sn m - (m) would
have no singularities and would be a doubly-periodic function; hence
\hardsubsectionref{20}{1}{2}) it would be a constant, and this constant vanishes, as may
be seen by putting u = 0; so that (tt) = sn u.

When 0< A; < 1, it is obvious that K and K' are real, and sn u is real
for real values of u and is a pure imaginary when a is a pure
imaginary.

(II) The function cm* is a doubly-periodic function of u with periods
K and 2K -+ 2iK'. It is analytic except at points congruent to iK' or
to 2ir-f- iK' (mod. 4/1", 2K - 2iK'); these points are simple poles,
the residues

%
% 505
%

at the first set being - ik~\ and the residues at the second set being
ik~; and the function has a simple zero at all points congruent to K
(mod. 2K, 2iK'). (Ill) The function dn u is a doubly-periodic function
of u with periods 2,K and 4iiK'. It is analytic except at points
congruent to iK' or to ZiK' (mod. ''2K, 4tiK'); these points are
simple poles, the residues at the first set being - i, and the
residues at the second set being i; and the function has a simple
zero at all points congruent to K + iK' (mod. 2K, 2iK').

[To see that the fvinctions have no zeros or poles other than those
just specified, recourse must be had to their definitions in terms of
Theta-functions.]

Now put V = 77/(1 - ?;-)-, where < 77 < 1, so that the range of values

range of values of t is from to 77.

Then dt = i t )- -idU, (1 - r-) = (1 -,-)-*,

general complex values of u and k.

stated above.

\Section{22}{7}{Elliptic integrals.}

An integi-al of the form IR(w, x)dx, where R denotes a rational
function

of w and x, and w is a QUARTIG, or CUBIC function of x (without
repeated factors), is called an elliptic integral*.

[Note. Elliptic integrals are of considerable historical importance,
owing to the fact that a very large number of important properties of
such integrals were discovered by Euler and Legendre before it was
realised that the inverses of certain standard types of such
integrals, rather than the integrals themselves, should be regarded as
fundamental functions of analjsis.

The first mathematician to deal with elliptic functions as opposed to
elliptic integrals was Gauss (§ 22 "S), but the first results
published were by Abelt and Jacobil.

The results obtained by Abel were brought to the notice of Legendre by
Jacobi immediately after the publication by Legendre of the Traite des
fonciions elliptiques. In the supplement (tome in. (1828), p. 1),
Legendre comments on their discoveries in the following terms: "A
peine mon ouvrage avait-il vu le jour, a peine son titre pouvait-il
§tre connu des .savans etrangers, que j'appris, avec autant
d'etonnement que de satisfaction, que deux jeunes geometres, IM.
Jacobi (C.-G.-J.) de Koeuigsberg et Abel de Christiania, avaient
reussi, par leurs travaux particuliers, a perfectionner
considerablement la theorie des fonctions elliptiques dans ses points
les plus eleves."

An interesting correspondence between Legendre and Jacobi was printed
in Journal fur Math. Lxxx. (1875), pp. 20.5-279; in one of the letters
Legendre refers to the claim of Gauss to have made in 1809 many of the
discoveries published by Jacobi and Abel. The validity of this claim
was established by Schering (see Gauss, Werke, in. (1876), pp. 493,
494), though the researches of Gauss ( Werke, in. pp. 404-460)
remained unpubli-shed until after his death.]

We shall now give a brief outline of the important theorem that every
elliptic integral can be evaluated by the aid of Theta-functions,
combined

* Strictly speaking, it is only called an elliptic integral when it
cannot be integrated by means of the elementary functions, and
consequently involves one of the three kinds of elliptic integrals
introduced in § 22 "72.

t Journal fur Math. ii. (1827), pp. 101-196.

i Jacobi announced his discovery in two letters (dated June 13, 1827
and August 2, 1827) to Schumacher, who published extracts from them in
Astr. Nach. vi. (No. 123) in September 1827 - the month in which

with the elementary functions of analysis; it has already been seen
\hardsectionref{20}{6}) that this process can be carried out in the special case of
jiv~ dx, since

the Weierstrassian elliptic functions can easily be expressed in terms
of Theta-functions and their derivates \hardsubsectionref{21}{7}{3}).

[The most important case practically is that in which R is a real
function of x and w, which are themselves real on the path of
integration; it will be shewn how, in such circumstances, the
integral may be expressed in a real form.]

Since R (lu, x) is a rational function of w and x we may write

R (w, x) = P (w, x)IQ w, x),

where P and Q denote polynomials in w and x; then we have

R(w x)= ' ~ ' ~ wQ (w, x) Q (- w, x) '

Now Q (w, x) Q (- w, x) is a rational function of w- and x, since it
is unaffected by changing the sign of lu; it is therefore expressible
as a rational function of x.

If now we multiply out wP w, x) Q (- w;, x) and substitute for w- in
terms of X wherever it occurs in the expression, we ultimately reduce
it to a poly- nomial in X and w, the polynomial being linear in iv. We
thus have an identity of the form

R (w, x) = Ri (x) + tvRz x)]lw,

by reason of the expression for w- as a quartic in x; where jRj and
R2 denote

rational functions of x.

Now \ Ro x) dx can be evaluated by means of elementary functions
only*;

so the problem is reduced to that of evaluating jw~ Ri (x) dx. To
carry out

this process it is necessary to obtain a canonical expression for w'-,
which we now proceed to do.

\Subsection{22}{7}{1}{The expression of a quartic as the product of sums of squares.}

It will now be shewn that any quartic (or cubicf) in x (with no
repeated factors) can be expressed in the form

 A,(x- a) + BJx- Y] A, (x - af + B, (x - f],

where, if the coefficients in the quartic are real, A, B, A.., B,
a, /3 are all real.

* The integratiou of rational functions of one variable is discussed
in text-books on Integral Calculus.

t In the following analysis, a cubic may be regarded as a quartic in
which the eoefiScient of X* vanishes.

W. M. A. 33

To obtain this result, we observe that any quartic can be expressed yi
the form S S.. where Si, S2 are quadratic in x, say*

<S'i = a x + 2biX + Ci, S.2 = aox- + 2h..x + c.,.

Now, X being a constant, 1 - \ S. will be a perfect square in x if

(tti - Xftj) (ci - Xco) - (61 - \ h - = 0.

Let the roots of this equation be X, X ', then, by hypothesis,
numbers a, yQ exist such that

Si - \ 1S.2 = (o-i - Xitto) (x - a)-. Si - X S.. (a I - Xstu) x - f;

on solving these as equations in j, S.,, we obviously get results of
the form

Si = Ai x- a)- + Bi x- /3)-, S. s A (x - a)- + Bo x - /S)

and the required reduction of the quartic has been effected.

[Note. If the quartic is real and has two or four complex factors, let
Si have com- plex factors; then Xi and Xi are real and distinct since

( ! - Xa2) (c'l - XC2)- (61- X62)

is positive when X = and negative! when X = ai/ 2.

When Si and S-i have real factors, say x - i) -v - i), - 2) - 2), the
condition that Xi and X2 should be real is easily found to be

( 1 - 2) (6' - 2) ( 1 - 2') ( 1' - f/) > 0,

a condition which is satisfied when the zeros of Si and those of \& do
not interlace; this was, of course, the reason for choosing the
factors S"! and So of the quartic in such a way that their zeros do
not interlace.]

\Subsection{22}{7}{2}{The three kinds of elliptic integrals.}

Let a, /3 be determined by the rule just obtained in \hardsubsectionref{22}{7}{1}, and, in

* If the coefficients in the quartic are real, the factorisation can
be carried out so that the coefficients in .Sj and So are real. In the
special case of the quartic having four real linear factors, these
factors should be associated in pairs (to give Sj and S2) in such a
waj* that the roots of one pair do not interlace the roots of the
other pair; tlie reason for this will be seen in the note at the end
of the section.

transformation to the elliptic functions which we shall introduce.

If we write R x) in the form ± (a - /3) R (t), where R is rational, we

But l (A,t;' + B,)(A.J' + Bo) tR, t")dt

can be evaluated in terms of elementary functions by taking t" as a

problem of

integrals of the following types:

 f A,P + B,) A,t' + B,)] - dt,

[(1 + m y A,t' + B,) A,t' + B,)] - dt;

in the former of these m is an integer, in the latter m is a positive
integer andi\ \ 0.

By differentiating expressions of the form

t? -' [ A,t + B,) A.J- + i?,)]*, t (1 + m y- [ A,i:' + B,) A,t' +

it is easy to obtain reduction formulae by means of which the above
integrals can be expressed in terms of one of the three canonical
forms:

(i) [ A,t + B,) A,P + B.;)]-idt, (ii) 1 [(.4, + B,) A,t- + B,)] -Ut,

(iii) [(1 + m )-' (A,t' + B,) A,r- + 5,) -idt.

These integrals were called by Legendref elliptic integrals of the
first, second and thii'd kinds, respectively.

The elliptic integral of the first kind presents no difficulty, as it
can be integrated at once by a substitution based on the integral
formulae of §§22121, 22-122; thus, if A B A., B., are all positive and
A B,>A,B., we write

A, t = Bi cs (u, k). [k'-' = (A,B,)/(A,B,).]

\Subsection{22}{7}{3}{The elliptic integral of the second kind. The function* E(u).}
To reduce an integral of the type

jf' (A,t' + B,) (A,t + B,)l - idt,

we employ the same elliptic function substitution as in the case of
that elliptic integral of the first kind which has the same expression
under the radical. We are thus led to one of the twelve integrals

jsn udu, icn udu, ... jnd' udu.

By \hardsubsectionref{22}{7}{2} example 3, these are all expressible in terms of u,

which all others can be expressed; when the modulus has to be
emphasized, we write E u, k) in place oi E u).

We observe that

dE(it)

= dn-u, E 0) = 0.

Further, since dn u is an even function with double poles at the
points 2mK + (2n + l)iK, the residue at each pole being zero, it is
easy to see that E(u) is an odd one-valuedf function of u with simple
poles at the poles of dn u.

It will now be shewn that E () may be expressed in terms of Theta-
functions; the most convenient type to employ is the function (u).

of © (u), i.e. at the poles of dn u, and so, if A be a suitably chosen

* This notation was introduced by Jacobi, Journal fiir Math. iv.

is a doubly-periodic function of u, with periods 2K, 2 K', with only a
single

simple pole in any cell. It is therefore a constant; this constant is
usually

written in the form JE/K. To determine the constant A, we observe that

the principal part of dn- u at iK' is - (u - iK')~, by \hardsubsubsectionref{22}{3}{4}{1}; and
the

residue of \&' (u)IS (u) at this pole is unity, so the principal part

E=( dn- ucZw=r (l-k'sm"-0dcf> = l7rF(-l, ~; 1; kA .

It is usual (cf.\hardsectionref{22}{3}) to call K and E the complete elliptic
integrals of the first and second kinds. Tables of them qua functions
of the modular angle are given by Legendre, Fonctions Elliptiques, ii.

Example 1. Shew that E u + 2nK)= E ti) + 2nE, where n is any integer.

Example 2. By expressing e u) in terms of the function 9 ( irulK), and
expanding about the point u = iK', shew that

\Subsubsection{22}{7}{3}{1}{The Zeta-f unction Z (w).}

The function E (u) is not periodic in either 2K or in 2iK', but,
associated with these periods, it has additive constants 2E, 2iK'E -
7ri]/K; it is convenient to have a function of the same general type
as E u) which is singly-periodic, and such a function is

Z (u) = ©' (m)/© (u); from this definition, we have*

Z (u) = E (ti) - uE/K, © (m) = © (0) exp I j" Z t) dt\ .

Consider the expression

e'(u + v) ©'(m) W(v),,,

-- ' / - T TT x - /-v / + f ' sn u sn V sn u + v)

@(u + v) ©(m) S v)

* The integral in the expression for (u) is not one-valued as Z (f)
has residue 1 at its poles; bat the difference of the integrals taken
along any two paths with the same end points is 2/i7r/ where n is the
number of poles enclosed, and the exponential of the integral is
therefore one- valued, as it should be, since 0(m) is one-valued.

%

qua function of m. It is doubly-periodic* (periods 2if and 2iK') with
simple poles congruent to iK' and to iK' - v; the residue of the
first two terms at iK' is - 1, and the residue of sn u sn v sn (u + v)
is k~ sn v sn (iK' + v) = k~ .

Hence the function is doubly-periodic and has no poles at points
congruent to iK' or (similarly) at points congruent to iK' - v. By
Liouville's theorem, it is therefore a constant, and, putting u = 0,
we see that the constant is zero.

Hence we have the addition-formulae

Z (w) -f- Z (v) - Z(u+v) = k sn M sn V sn (?< + v),

E(u) + E (v) - Eiu 4- v) = k sn u sn v sn u + v).

[Note. Since Z u) and E (u) are not doubly- periodic, it is possible
to prove that no algebraic relation can exist connecting them with sn
u, en u and dn u, so these are not addition-theoreras in the strict
sense t.]

\Subsubsection{22}{7}{3}{3}{Jacobi's imaginary transformation\ of7i u).}

From \hardsubsectionref{21}{5}{1} it is fairly evident that there must be a transformation
of Jacobi's type for the function Z ii). To obtain it, we translate
the formula

 2 ix i t) = (- ir) exp (- iTX /ir) . 4 (ixr \ r) into Jacobi's
earlier notation, when it becomes

Hence, from \hardsubsectionref{22}{7}{2} example 3, we have

E hi, k) = i \ u + dn u, k') sc (, k') - \ dn= t', k') dt' [,

and so E iu, k) = iu + i dn u, k') sc u, k') - iE u, k').

This is the transformation stated.

It is convenient to write E' to denote the same function of k' as E is
of k, i.e. E' = E(K', k'X so that

E 2 K',k) = 2i(K' -E').

\Subsubsection{22}{7}{3}{5}{Legendre's relation*.}

From the transformations of E u) and Z u) just obtained, it is
possible to derive a remarkable relation connecting the two kinds of

evident that, for purposes of computation, a result of this nature is
preferable to the corresponding result in terms of Sigma-functions and
Weierstrassian Zeta-functions, for the reasons that the
Theta-functious have a specially simple behaviour with respect to
their real period - the period which is of importance in Applied
Mathe- matics - and that the -series are much better adapted for
computation than the product by which the Sigma-function is most

relation between and x by writingi* x - sin lemn < .

In like manner, if

J X - .'

we write

x = cos lemn j, and we have the relation

sin lemn < = cos lemn ( tn- - ( j .

These lemniscate functions, which were the first functions:]: defined
by the inversion of an integral, can easily be expressed in terms of
elliptic functions with modulus l/VS; for, from the formula \hardsubsubsectionref{22}{1}{2}{2}
example)

r sd u u=\ [ l-k' f) l+l: f)]-Uy,

it is easy to see (on writing y = t \/2) that

sin lemn = 2 " sd (< \/2, l/V ); similarly, cos lemn = en (</> V2, 1/

Further, is the smallest positive value of for which

cn(< V2, 1/V2) = 0, so that OT=V2 o,

is formed with the particular modulus l/\/2.

This result renders it possible to express Kq in terms of
Gamma-functions,

thus

a result first obtained by Legendre§.

Since k = // when k = l/\/2, it follows that 7 = 7iV. and so o = e ".

\Subsection{22}{8}{1}{The values of K and K' for special values of k.}

It has been seen that, when k=ljJ2, K can be evaluated in terms of
Gamma-functions, and K=E'; this is a special case of a general
theorem* that, whenever

E' \ a + hjn E c + djn'' where, b, c, d, n are integers, k is a root
of an algebraic equation with integral coefficients.

This theorem is based on the theory of the transformation of elliptic
functions and is beyond the scope of this book; but there are three
distinct cases in which k, 7i, E' all have fairly simj le values,
namely

(I) >(- = V2-l, E' = EJ2,

(II) k = Hm 7r, E' = E %

(III) k=tsin 7r, E' 2E. Of these we shall give a brief investigation
t.

(I) The quarter-periods with the modulus /2 - 1.

Landen's transformation gives a relation between elliptic functions
with any modulus k and those with modulus ki = l - k')/ l+k'); and the
quarter-periods A, A' associated with the modulus k satisfy the
relation A'/a = 2E'/E.

If we choose k so that ky = k', then A = /i'' and k = k so that i. ' =
E; and the relation A7A=2A'7A'gives A'2=2a2.

Therefore the quarter-periods A, A' associated with the modulus k-
given by the equation i = (l - i)/(l-|-X-i) are such that A'=±Av/2;
i.e. \ i ki = l2-\, then A' = Av/2 (since A, A' obviously are both
positive).

(II) The quarter-periods associated ivith the modidus sin y tt.

The case of k = s,\ n -rrr was discussed by Legendre|; he obtained the
remarkable result that, with this value of k,

E' = Ey/3.

This result follows from the relation between detinite integi-als

To obtain this relation, consider l l-z )~ dz taken round the contour
formed by the part of the real axis (indented at s=l by an arc of
radius R' ) joining the points and B the line joining e*"' to and the
arc of radius B joining the points R and Re ""; as R a:, the
integral round the arc tends to zero, as does the integral round the
indentation, and so, by Cauchy's theorem,

on writing .v and e*'"* respectively for z on the two straight lines.
Writing [\ l-x )- -dx = Ii, j\ x- -l)- dx = L, j\ l+.f )-- ds=j\ l-x
)- dx I

we have /j + iV. = 4 (1 + is/S) h;

so, equating real and imaginary parts,

A = 5- 3 5 - 2 = 5- 3X 3,

and therefore h-V I - Lis'' = \ h + h-¥i=

which is the relation stated*. Now, by \hardsubsectionref{22}{7}{2} example 6,

/2 = 4(a2 + 2)-*£', / + /3 = 4(a2 + /32)-4 ',

where the modulus is a d' + ) ~ and

a2=2v3-3, /32 = 2V3 + 3, so that, >:2 = i(2-V3) = sin2Js7r.

We therefore have

3-i. 2/1 = 3-2. 2 ' = /2 = 3 /i

= 3- |V"s(i- )-ic =i,r r(J)/r(|),

when the modulus k is sin jV -

(III) The quarter-periods iiith the modtdus tan -i-Tr.

If, in Landen's transformation \hardsubsectionref{22}{4}{2}), we take l::=i; '2, we have
A'/A=2K'/K=2;

now this value of k gives

7 V -1 . "1

and the corresponding quarter-periods \, A' are |(1 + 2 ) A'o and (1 +
2 ) Kq.

Example 1. Discuss the quarter-i)eriods when k has the values
(2;,y2-2), sin f 7r, and 2 ( 2-1).

* Another method of obtaining the relation is to express Ij, I, h in
terms of Gamma- functions by writing t, t~, ( -' - 1)* respectively
for x in the integrals by which Ii, I2, I3 are defined.

\Subsection{22}{8}{2}{A geometrical illustration of tlie functions sn u, en ii, dn u.}

A geometrical representation of Jacobian elliptic functions with
k=ljJ2 is afforded by the arc of the lemniscate, as has been seen in §
22"8; to represent the Jacobian functions with any modulus k 0 <k < )
, we may make use of a curve described on a sphere, known as Seifferfs
spherical spiral .

Take a sphere of radius unity with centre at the origin, and let the
cylindrical polar coordinates of any point on it l e (p,, z), so that
the arc of a curve traced on the sphere is given by the formula \

 dsr =pHdcf>y+ i-p )- dpy.

* It is interesting to observe that, when Legendre had proved by
differentiation that EK' + E'K- KK' is constant, he used the results
of examples 4 and 5 to determine the constant, before using the
methods of \hardsectionref{22}{8} example 3 and of \hardsubsubsectionref{22}{7}{3}{7}.

t Seiffert, Ueher eine neue geometrische Eiiifilhrung in die Theorie
der elliptisclien Funktiunen (Charlottenburg, 1896).

X This is an obvious transformation of the formula ds)"= dp)' + p'
(d(p)~ + dz) when p and z are connected by the relation p' + z'- - l.

%
% 528
%

Seiffert's spiral is defined by the equation

(f) = ks,

where s is the arc measured from the pole of the sphere (i.e. the
point where the axis of s meets the sphere) and k is a positive
constant, less than unity*.

For this curve we have

and so, since s and p vanish together,

p = sn (s, k).

The cylindrical polar coordinates of any point on the curve expressed
in terms of the arc measured from the pole are therefore

 p, cf), z) = (sn s, /ts, en s);

and dn s is easily seen to be the cosine of the angle at which the
curve cuts the meridian. Hence it may be seen that, if K be the arc of
the curve from the pole to the equator, then sn s and cu s have period
AK, while dn 6* has period 2K.

where | and rj are real, and equating imaginary parts on either side
of the equation was obtained by Thomson and Tait, Natural Philosopki
ii. (1883), p. 249, but they failed to observe that their formula was
nothing but a consequence of Jacobi's imaginary transformation. The
formula was suggested to Thomson and Tait by the solution of a problem
in the theory of Elasticity.]
